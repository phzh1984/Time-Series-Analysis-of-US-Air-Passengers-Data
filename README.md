# Time-Series-Analysis-of-US-Air-Passengers-Data

Overview

This repository contains an exploration and analysis of the US Air Passengers dataset, which provides monthly totals of airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The primary focus is to conduct time series analysis, understand the inherent patterns.

Time Series Analysis

The analysis primarily focuses on understanding and extracting meaningful statistics, patterns, and characteristics inherent in time series data. Here's a brief overview of the components and techniques used in this analysis:

Components of Time Series

Trend: Demonstrates the general direction of the time series over an extended period (upward, downward, or horizontal).

Seasonality: Represents recurring trends concerning timing, direction, and magnitude, such as patterns seen in specific seasons or periods.

Cyclical Component: Trends without specific repetition over a defined period, often observed in business cycles.

Irregular Variation: Unpredictable fluctuations once trend and cyclical variations are removed.

ETS Decomposition

The analysis includes ETS (Error, Trend, and Seasonality) decomposition. This method is used to disentangle different components within the time series, providing insights into the underlying patterns of the data.

Applications and Importance

Time series analysis is crucial in various fields, including statistics, finance, and business applications. This analysis showcases the importance of understanding time series data for forecasting future trends and making informed decisions.
